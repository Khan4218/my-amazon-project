- **JavaScript Functionality:**
  - Add-to-cart buttons for all products
  - Real-time quantity and subtotal updates
  - Cart persistence using `localStorage`
  - Dynamic product rendering from modularized data
  - Order simulation and price calculation logic

- **Responsive Design:**
  - Mobile-friendly layout using Flexbox & Grid
  - Consistent styling across reusable components

- **Organized File Structure:**
  - `scripts/` – JavaScript logic
  - `styles/` – Shared and page-specific CSS
  - `images/` – Categorized assets (icons, products, ratings)
